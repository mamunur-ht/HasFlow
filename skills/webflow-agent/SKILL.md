# Webflow Skills

You have access to specialized skills for working with Webflow sites through the Webflow MCP server.

## Prerequisites

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Webflow MCP Server Required**

These skills require the Webflow MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to be installed and configured. Without Webflow MCP, these skills will not function.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Webflow MCP Server**

   Add the Webflow MCP server to Claude Code:

   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport http webflow https://mcp.webflow.com/mcp
   ```

2. **Authenticate with Webflow**

   Follow the authentication prompts to connect your Webflow account.

3. **Verify Installation**

   Test the connection by calling `data_sites_tool` with action `list_sites` to confirm access to Webflow sites.

### What Webflow MCP Provides

The Webflow MCP server enables:

- ✅ Access to all Webflow sites in your account
- ✅ CMS operations (collections, items, fields)
- ✅ Page operations (content, metadata, settings)
- ✅ Designer integration (when Designer is open)
- ✅ Asset management
- ✅ Publishing capabilities
- ✅ Custom code management

**Without Webflow MCP installed, you cannot:**

- ❌ List or access Webflow sites
- ❌ Read or modify CMS content
- ❌ Update pages or publish changes
- ❌ Use any of the Webflow skills

## Webflow MCP Tools Reference

When working with Webflow skills, these MCP tools are available:

### Core Site Operations

- `webflow_guide_tool` - **Always call first** to get best practices

  - **Items**: `list_collection_items`, `create_collection_items`, `update_collection_items`, `publish_collection_items`, `delete_collection_items`

### Page Operations

- `data_pages_tool` - Consolidated tool for page operations with actions:
  - `list_pages` - List all pages in site
  - `get_page_metadata` - Get page SEO settings
  - `update_page_settings` - Update page metadata, SEO, slug
  - `get_page_content` - Get page content structure
  - `update_static_content` - Update page content (requires Designer)

### Component Operations

  - `list_components` - List all components
  - `get_component_content` - Get component structure
  - `update_component_content` - Update component content
  - `get_component_properties` - Get component properties
  - `update_component_properties` - Update component properties

### Scripts & Custom Code

- `data_scripts_tool` - Consolidated tool for script operations with actions:
  - `list_registered_scripts` - List registered scripts
  - `list_applied_scripts` - Get applied scripts

### Designer Tools (requires Designer connection)

These tools remain action-based and unchanged:

- `element_tool` - Get/select elements, update attributes, styles, links
- `element_builder` - Create elements (max 3 levels deep per call)
  - ⚠️ **Depth limit warning**: Real HTML often nests deeper than 3 levels. For converting HTML to Webflow, use the following chunking strategy:
    1. Identify the deepest subtrees in the HTML
    2. Build from the **inside out** — create the deepest child element first as a standalone component
    3. Reference that component in the next outer call
    4. Repeat upward until the full structure is assembled
    5. Never attempt to pass more than 3 nesting levels in a single `element_builder` call — excess levels are silently dropped
- `de_component_tool` - Manage components and instances
- `de_page_tool` - Create pages/folders, switch pages
- `style_tool` - Create and update styles
- `variable_tool` - Manage design variables
- `asset_tool` - Manage assets and folders
- `de_learn_more_about_styles` - Reference for supported styles

### Helper Tools

These tools remain standalone:

- `ask_webflow_ai` - Ask questions about Webflow API
- `get_image_preview` - Preview images from URLs

## Skill Invocation Patterns

### Pattern 1: User Explicitly Requests Skill

```
User: "Run a site audit on my Webflow site"
→ Invoke: site-audit skill
```

### Pattern 2: Task Matches Skill Description

```
User: "I need to add 20 blog posts to my site"
→ Invoke: bulk-cms-update skill

User: "Check if my site has broken links"
→ Invoke: link-checker skill

User: "Help me structure my CMS for a recipe site"
→ Invoke: cms-best-practices skill
```

### Pattern 3: User References Skill by Name

```
User: "Use the safe-publish skill to publish my site"
→ Invoke: safe-publish skill
```

### When NOT to Invoke Skills

- Simple one-off operations (use MCP tools directly)
- User asks general questions about Webflow (answer directly)
- Task requires different approach than available skills

## Important Usage Guidelines

### 1. Site ID Requirements

- **Never assume site IDs** - Always use `data_sites_tool` with action `list_sites` to fetch available sites
- **Ask user to select** - If multiple sites, let user choose by name or number
- **Confirm site name** - Verify you're working on the correct site

### 2. Context Parameter (Required)

All Webflow MCP tools require a `context` parameter:

- **Length**: 15-25 words (count carefully)
- **Perspective**: Third-person (not "I", "we", or "you")
- **Content**: Explain what action is being performed and why
- **Example**: "Retrieving all CMS collections from the site to analyze content structure and identify optimization opportunities for improved performance."

### 3. Designer Connection

Some operations require Webflow Designer:

- Static page content updates
- Element creation and styling
- Component management
- Variable management

**Pre-flight check (required before calling Designer tools):**

Before calling any Designer-dependent tool (`update_static_content`, `element_tool`, `element_builder`, `de_component_tool`, `de_page_tool`, `style_tool`, `variable_tool`), check if the operation requires Designer by reviewing the tool list above. If it does, verify the connection state **before** making the call — not after failure. Use `ask_webflow_ai` to confirm Designer status if uncertain.

**If Designer required but not connected:**

```
⚠️ Designer Connection Required

This operation needs Webflow Designer to be open and connected.

Steps:
1. Open Webflow Designer
2. Open your site
3. Ensure Designer is connected
4. Retry operation

Note: CMS operations can proceed without Designer.
```

### 4. Batch Processing

For large operations:

- **CMS items**: Process in batches of 50
- **Pages**: Process in batches of 10-20
- **Links**: Validate in batches of 100
- **Always show progress** for batches
- **Rate limit recovery (cursor tracking)**: When a rate limit is hit mid-batch, record the index of the last successfully processed item before pausing. On resume, start from `lastSuccessfulIndex + 1` — never retry the whole batch. This prevents duplicate writes on already-processed items.

  ```
  Batch state to track:
  - batchStartIndex: where this batch began
  - lastSuccessfulIndex: last item confirmed written
  - On rate limit: pause 60s, resume from lastSuccessfulIndex + 1
  ```

### 5. Draft vs Live Operations

Choose the right endpoint:

- **Draft operations**: `*_items`, `*_item` (requires manual publish)
- **Live operations**: `*_items_live`, `*_item_live` (publishes immediately)
- **Publishing**: Use `publish_collection_items` (via `data_cms_tool`) to publish drafts — note: `publish_items` does NOT exist

## Safety Rules

### Mandatory Preview + Confirmation

Always follow this pattern for write operations:

**1. Discovery Phase:**

```
🔍 [Operation Name]

Analyzing current state...
[Show what will be affected]
```

**2. Preview Phase:**

```
📋 Preview: [Operation Name]

[Show detailed changes]
[Include validation warnings]

⚠️ Type "[confirm]" to proceed.
```

**3. Execution Phase:**

```
🔄 Applying changes...

Progress: ████████████████████ 100% (X/Y items)

[Show real-time progress]
```

**4. Confirmation Phase:**

```
✅ [Operation] Complete

Summary:
- Items processed: X
- Successful: Y
- Failed: Z

[Detailed results]
```

### Preview Requirements

Before ANY write operation, show:

1. **What will change** - Specific items and fields
2. **Validation warnings** - Any issues detected
3. **Impact assessment** - How many items affected
4. **Confirmation prompt** - Clear action required

### Granular Approval

For bulk operations, allow selective approval:

```
Which items would you like to update?
- Type "all" to proceed with all
- Type numbers to skip (e.g., "2,4,7")
- Type "none" to cancel

Example: Typing "2,4" will update all except items 2 and 4
```

### Error Handling

When errors occur:

1. **Explain clearly** - What went wrong and why
2. **Suggest recovery** - Actionable steps to resolve
3. **Report partial success** - Separate successes from failures
4. **Offer retry** - For failed operations

Example:

```
❌ 3 Items Failed

Failed items:
- Item 5: Slug already exists
- Item 8: Required field missing
- Item 12: Reference points to deleted item

✅ 17 items updated successfully

Would you like to:
1. Fix the 3 failed items and retry
2. Continue without failed items
3. Cancel and review all items
```

## Response Format Standards

├── Item 1
│   ├── Field: value
│   └── Field: value
├── Item 2
│   └── Field: value
└── Item 3
```

### Tables

For structured data:

```
| # | Name | Status | Details |
|---|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Item | ✅ | Success |
| 2 | Item | ⚠️ | Warning |
| 3 | Item | ❌ | Failed |
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Start with webflow_guide_tool

```
Before using any Webflow MCP tool:
1. Call webflow_guide_tool first
2. Review the guidance
3. Then proceed with specific tools
```

### 2. Validate Before Modifying

```
For any write operation:
1. Read current state
2. Validate proposed changes
3. Check for conflicts/issues
4. Show preview with warnings
5. Get user confirmation
6. Apply changes
7. Verify success
```

### 3. Handle Large Operations

```
If >50 items to process:
1. Inform user of batch processing
2. Process in chunks of 50
3. Show progress after each batch
4. Report batch successes/failures
5. Continue or pause based on errors
```

### 4. Provide Context

```
Good context examples:

✅ "Retrieving collection schema to validate field types before bulk update operation"
✅ "Publishing site changes to production domain after user confirmation of preview"
✅ "Scanning all pages and CMS items to identify broken links for repair"

❌ "Getting data" (too vague)
❌ "I need to fetch collections" (first person)
❌ "User wants to update items" (references user directly)
```

### 5. Report Thoroughly

```
After any operation, report:
- What was done
- How many items affected
- Any errors or warnings
- What changed (before/after)
- Next recommended steps
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Running Site Audit

```
User: "Audit my Webflow site"

1. Call webflow_guide_tool
2. Call data_sites_tool with action list_sites
3. Ask user to select site
4. Invoke site-audit skill
5. Skill handles full workflow
6. Report results to user
```

### Example: Safe Publish (with real verification)

```
User: "Publish my site"

1. Call webflow_guide_tool
2. Call data_sites_tool with action list_sites → get site
3. Call data_sites_tool with action get_site → extract domain(s) array
4. Show preview of what will be published
5. Wait for user to type "publish"
6. Call data_sites_tool with action publish_site with the real domain(s) from step 3
7. For each CMS collection → call data_cms_tool with action publish_collection_items
8. Wait 3–5 seconds for CDN propagation
9. Call data_sites_tool with action get_site → verify lastPublished timestamp updated
10. Report: domains published, CMS collections published, timestamp confirmed
```
